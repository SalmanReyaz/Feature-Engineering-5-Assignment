    "1. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "         Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy among its categories, and this order is meaningful for the analysis or prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider an \"Education Level\" variable with categories \"High School,\" \"Associate's Degree,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" You could encode these categories as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, to capture the ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Ordinal encoding explicitly preserves the ordinal relationships, making it suitable for variables with clear order. It can be used in cases where the order of the categories matters in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "              Label encoding is used when the categorical variable represents nominal data, meaning there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories. It is used when the categories are distinct but not ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For a nominal categorical variable like \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" you might assign labels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Label encoding is simple and efficient for nominal data. It can reduce dimensionality when there are many categories, as it uses a single column with integer labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the nature of the categorical variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Choose ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has a meaningful order, and you want to capture that order in the analysis or modeling. It is suitable for ordinal data where the sequence of categories matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Use ordinal encoding for \"Education Level,\" \"Economic Status\" (e.g., \"Low Income,\" \"Middle Income,\" \"High Income\"), or \"Satisfaction Level\" (e.g., \"Low Satisfaction,\" \"Moderate Satisfaction,\" \"High Satisfaction\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Choose label encoding when the categorical variable represents nominal data, and there is no meaningful order among the categories. It is a straightforward way to convert nominal data into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Use label encoding for \"Gender\" (e.g., \"Male,\" \"Female\"), \"Country\" (e.g., \"USA,\" \"Canada,\" \"UK\"), or \"Product Type\" (e.g., \"Product A,\" \"Product B,\" \"Product C\")."

    "\n",
    "Scenario: Loan Approval Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a loan approval prediction project for a bank. One of the features in your dataset is \"Credit Score Range,\" which represents the range of credit scores of loan applicants. This feature is ordinal in nature, as it has categories like \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" \"Very Good,\" and \"Excellent,\" reflecting the creditworthiness of applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Poor\" corresponds to applicants with low credit scores.\n",
    "\"Excellent\" corresponds to applicants with high credit scores.\n",
    "In this scenario, you want to capture the ordinal relationship between \"Credit Score Range\" and the likelihood of loan approval (the target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean or median approval rate for each \"Credit Score Range\" category. You might find that \"Excellent\" applicants have the highest approval rate, while \"Poor\" applicants have the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank the categories based on their approval rates. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Excellent\" (Rank 5, highest approval rate)\n",
    "\"Very Good\" (Rank 4)\n",
    "\"Good\" (Rank 3)\n",
    "\"Fair\" (Rank 2)\n",
    "\"Poor\" (Rank 1, lowest approval rate)\n",
    "Replace the original \"Credit Score Range\" categories with their corresponding ranks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Category\tTarget Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "Poor\t                 1\n",
    "Fair\t                 2\n",
    "Good\t                 3\n",
    "Very Good\t             4\n",
    "Excellent              \t 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you have transformed the ordinal \"Credit Score Range\" variable into numerical values that reflect the ordinal relationship between credit scores and loan approval rates, making it suitable for machine learning models. This encoding method helps the model capture the impact of creditworthiness on loan approval more effectively."

    "For nominal categorical variables like \"Education Level,\" where there is no inherent order or ranking among categories, one-hot encoding is typically the preferred method. Each category gets its binary column, and this allows the algorithm to treat each category as distinct without assuming any ordinal relationship between them.\n",

    "For ordinal categorical variables like \"Employment Status,\" where there is an inherent order or ranking among categories, you can use label encoding. Label encoding assigns integer values to categories based on their order. In this case, the order might be Unemployed < Part-Time < Full-Time.\n",
